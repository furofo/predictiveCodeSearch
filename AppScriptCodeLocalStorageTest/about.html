              department. Particularly it is a bunch of different dictionaries that are defined in an excel 
              spreadsheet, in a way that makes sense to the department it is being used for.  It has some 
              predefined dictionaries built in and an excel sheet predefined that it links to. The 
              user can also link to their own spreadsheet in the setup page for the dictionary to use if they have 
              editor access to the spreadsheet and follow the formatting guidelines listed in  
              the (make this a link) HowTo Section.</li>
