            The navigation menu sits at top of page and allows 
            you to go to different web pages of the tool, by clicking them.  
            The current web page will be highlighted in black. The navigation 
            menu should look like image above. Next, each page will be reviewed in further detail.

        <p class = "setupGuide">
            The default/home page has two sections. These are copy buttons that copy predefined coes or codes linked from a google sheet; and a code lookup tool that looks up linked codes from a google sheet and diplays them with their definition and the name of the dictionary they came from displayed above. An example of google sheet in proper formate will be listed below.

       <button class = "exampleButton"> Break Numbershare </button>

    </div>

    <div class = "center">
        <p class = "setupGuide">
            This section (pictured above) consists of buttons like listed above, 
            when the button is clicked a predefined code is copied to 
            the clipboard so the user can paste it else where. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "center">
     <p class = "setupGuide">
           You can change these buttons from a linked google sheet. To do this, first name one of the sheets ButtonSetup (code lookup tool will ignore this as a result). You can also put the value ButtonSetup in the third column and second row of the sheet. Then you can put values Button Text, Copy Value and Sheet Name  from left to right in the first row of the spreadsheet. (This row is optional but doing this will help with readiblity. )
        </p>
    </div>

      <div class = "center">
     <p class = "setupGuide">
           Then for each button you want to change, use the Button Text column for the button label (text on the button), and the Copy Value column for the value that copies to your clip board when you click it. This will work for the first three rows which correspond to  the three buttons on the home page.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class = "center">
     <p class = "setupGuide">
          If you want to delete a button, simply type DELETE in Copy Value Column, this will also work for all three buttons and remove button toolbar complelty if all three have values of DELETE.
