This is read me for first version of predictive code search tool. Goal is to have input that when you type text will look through multiple,
Array/ dictionaires and show predetive text searching of each. 


Dictorany / Objects should be in this format

let someDict = {

	HEADING: this is tring that represents text that shows up in predective text
	CODES: jhouses another object with codes as keys adn definitions as vaues
	DISPLAYCODE: function(key) {
			this takes dictiomary key as string and outputs html as string to display below heading
					}


}
