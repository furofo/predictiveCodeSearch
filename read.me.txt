This is read me for first version of predictive code search tool. Goal is to have input that when you type text will look through multiple,
Array/ dictionaires and show predetive text searching of each. 


Dictorany / Objects should be in this format

let someDict = {

	HEADING: this is tring that represents text that shows up in predective text
	CODES: jhouses another object with codes as keys adn definitions as vaues
	DISPLAYCODE: function(key) {
			this takes dictiomary key as string and outputs html as string to display below heading
					}


}

Current functionality reads from google sheets as well and adds to dictionary using first column as key 2nd column as Value
and treats each sheet in google sheet as separte dictionary
Hover effect appears borken on one monitor for predecive text however for some reason may need additoinal testing.

Also wouuld like to implement a url link to code element that can hover over and slightly illumates
backgroudn if has a link to go to that link may need to update object streuctufre for this.
